Hi, I am Nolan Foy, and this is my personal README for my profile, and for my Signature Work Portfolio.
I am currently in my last semester at St. Thomas, and I will be working for Optum in late January after graduation after I had interned with them over 
the summer of 2022. 

In my free time I like to play basketball, volleyball, and other sports, as well as watch them, and I am a huge Vikings fan. I also like to go out with my friends, 
try new drinks, and play video games. 

I first got into coding when I was a freshman in high school and took an introduction to computer programming class. I really liked it right away, and I pretty much
decided what I was going to go into right after that because of how much I enjoyed it, and how little I enjoyed other classes.

Here, I will list and describe 3 projects of mine that I have made over my time at St. Thomas that encapsulate some of the things I've learned here. 

1. Personal Website
  - This is my personal website that I made as an assignment in my Web Development class, which taught me the basic tools of making a site.
  - Website: https://nolanfoy.github.io/
  - Repository: https://github.com/nolanfoy/nolanfoy.github.io

2. Creative Coding Final Project
  - This is my final project in my Creative Coding Practices and Techniques class.
  - It is called "Your Unique Life"
  - Repository (Including Instructions on how to use it): https://github.com/nolanfoy/CreativeCodingFinal
  - Project site: https://nolanfoy.github.io/CreativeCodingFinal/index.html
 
3. Dynamic Server Project
 - This is from an assignment in Web Development with my group Andrew Steichen, and Mitchell Covey, where we made a dynamic server.
 - This project takes a look at sustainability, particularily with energy consumption and how the powerplants around the world make energy. We dynamically made a web page that had all sorts of powerplant data from around the world. We were able to look at how many sustainable and renewable powerplants that there are around the world, as well as see just how many bad gas, oil, and coal powerplants there are.
